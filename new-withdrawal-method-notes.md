Overview
========

The new simplified withdrawal method removes the requirement for oDAO to submit starting and ending balances. It also removes the requirement for a minipool to be `Withdrawable`
in order to perform a withdraw. Furthermore, the new method does not rely on any Rocket Pool upgradable contracts to run and can be called by anyone (not just the node operator). 
These changes significantly reduce the oDAOs power over the network by limiting their ability to upgrade contracts and direct funds to themselves. 

Note: the oDAO still marks minipools as `Withdrawable` and node operators can then destroy a minipool. The purpose for this is that we still need to know if a minipool is staking in order
to issue the correct RPL rewards. The important thing is that ending balances are no longer submitted and the `Withdrawable` status is not required to process a withdrawal.

Methods
=======

There are now two withdrawal methods `processWithdrawal()` and `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()` the later just being a convenience method that node operators can call to withdraw and
destroy the pool in a single transaction.

`processWithdrawal()` can be called multiple times but each time is treated as if the entire balance is the full validator withdrawal amount.

The below conditions must be met to call the two relevant withdrawal methods on a minipool:

processWithdrawalAndDestroy()
------------------------------

* Minipool must be `Withdrawable`.
* Can only be called by minipool owner.

processWithdrawal()
-------------------

* If minipool is `Staking`
    * Balance must be greater than 16 ETH
* If minipool is `Withdrawable`
    * Can be called by owner; or
    * If called by non-owner
        * Balance must be greater than 16 ETH; or
        * 50,000 blocks must have passed since being made `Withdrawable`


Scenarios
=========

Below is a comprehensive list of the potential withdraw scenarios for the new withdrawal process.

Scenario A - More than 32 ETH is returned to the minipool
---------------------------------------------------------
1. The oDAO marks the minipool as `Withdrawable`.
2. NO calls `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()`.
3. User funds are returned to rETH contract + share of rewards - node commission.
4. NO funds are returned + share of rewards + node commission.
5. NO's minipool count is decremented so they can now withdraw their RPL stake via `withdraw()` method.

Scenario B - More than 32 ETH is returned to contract but the oDAO is not functioning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. oDAO does not mark pool as `Withdrawable` so the minipool remains in `Staking` status.
2. NO can still call `processWithdrawal()` as it does not interact with any network contracts or `RocketStorage`.
3. User funds are returned to rETH contract + share of rewards - node commission.
4. NO funds are returned + share of rewards + node commission.
5. NO cannot `withdraw()` their RPL because their minipool has not been destroyed.

> Note: NO cannot call `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()` because it requires minipool to be in `Withdrawable` state. It also interacts with other network contracts which may have been maliciously upgraded. However, if there is a malicious contract or inoperable oDAO than RPL will have lost it's value and there is no need to destroy the pool to recover RPL stake. The only useful course of action is to recover ETH which is what this method does.

Scenario C - Less than 32 ETH but more than 16 ETH is returned
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. oDAO marks pool as `Withdrawable`.
2. NO calls `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()`.
3. 16 ETH is returned to rETH contract.
4. Remaining ETH is returned to NO.
5. NO can `withdraw()` their RPL stake.

> Note: works as long as NO still receives enough ETH to make it worth the gas. If not, see Scenario D

Scenario D - Less than 32 ETH but more than 16 ETH is returned and NO won't process withdrawal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. oDAO marks pool as `Withdrawable`.
2. Anyone can call `processWithdrawal()` if pool because minipool is `Withdrawable` and balance is > 16 ETH.
3. 16 ETH is returned to rETH contract.
4. Remaining ETH is returned to NO.
5. NO can call `destroy()` if they want to destroy to pool to unlock their RPL stake.

Scenario E - Less than 16 ETH is returned
-----------------------------------------
1. oDAO marks pool as `Withdrawable`.
2. NO wants their RPL stake back so they are forced to call `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()` to free up their stake.
3. Total balance is sent to rETH contract.
4. NO's RPL is slashed and auctioned in an attempt to make up the loss.
5. NO can `withdraw()` any remaining RPL.

> Note: unless the NO's RPL is worth a lot of value, it is unlikely they will call this method. If so, see Scenario F.

Scenario F - Less than 16 ETH is returned and NO won't process withdrawal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. oDAO marks pool as `Withdrawable`.
2. After 50,000 blocks pass since status change anyone can now call `processWithdrawal()`.
3. Appropriate amount of RPL to slash is recorded on minipool contract.
4. Total balance is sent to rETH contract.
5. If NO wants to withdraw their RPL stake they must call `destroy()` which slashes their RPL and auctions it to recoup loss.
6. Alternatively, if the incentive is not there for them to do so, anyone can call `slash()` to execute the slashing on behalf of the network.

> Note: `processWithdrawal()` purposefully doesn't execute the slash method as this method reads from RocketStorage. The two methods have been kept separate so that processing withdrawals do not rely on RocketStorage or any other network contract.
> Note: The 50k block delay is to prevent public from calling `processWithdrawal()` if the oDAO has set the minipool to withdrawable but funds have not been withdrawn yet. It is approx. 7-10 days. It also allows a NO enough time to withdraw if a
> malicious oDAO marks their pool as withdrawable before it actually is.

Scenario G - Less than 16 ETH is returned and oDAO is not functioning
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Less than 16 ETH is returned to minipool.
2. oDAO does not mark pool as `Withdrawable`.
3. NO is forced to call `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()` to get their stake back.
4. Total balance is sent to rETH contract.
5. NO's RPL is slashed and auctioned in an attempt to make up the loss.
6. NO can `withdraw()` any remaining RPL.

> Note: This scenario fails if there isn't a great enough incentive for NO to call `processWithdrawalAndDestroy()` i.e. their RPL stake is not worth enough for it to be worthwhile (which is likely given a malicious or inoperable oDAO). We can't just allow anyone to call `processWithdrawal()` if the pool is still `Staking` and there is less than 16 ETH because that would allow anyone to grief NOs by slashing them. This is worst case scenario and results in loss of funds but should be exceptionally unlikely as slashings greater than 16 ETH will already be incredibly unlikely and then top it off with a malicious oDAO.
